Runs Game of Life with different starting conditions including Toad, Beacon, Blinker, Glider, Gosper Glider Gun and Random.
This program runs infinitely by following rules of life:
* Any live cell with 0 or 1 live neighbors becomes dead, because of underpopulation
* Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors stays alive, because its neighborhood is just right
* Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbors becomes dead, because of overpopulation
* Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive, by reproduction

Run this code by: python run_game_of_life.py 
and hypnotize yourself with the patterns
