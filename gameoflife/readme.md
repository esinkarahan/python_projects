Runs Game of Life with different starting conditions including Toad, Beacon, Blinker, Glider, Gosper Glider Gun and Random.
This program runs infinitely by following rules of life:
# 1 Any live cell with 0 or 1 live neighbors becomes dead, because of underpopulation
# 2 Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors stays alive, because its neighborhood is just right
# 3 Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbors becomes dead, because of overpopulation
# 4 Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive, by reproduction

Run this code by: python run_game_of_life.py 
and hypnotize yourself with the patterns
